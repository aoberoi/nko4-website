    ## <a name="nodejitsu">Nodejitsu</a>

    Nodejitsu's platform actually gives you access to [free instances of several
    popular databases](https://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook#databases).

    - **[CouchDB](https://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook#couchdb)** —
      If you run `jitsu databases create couchdb myCouch`, jitsu will tell you
      the url for your new couchdb from iriscouch.

    - **[Redis](https://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook#redis)** —
      Running `jitsu databases create redis myRedis` will create a redis instance
      supplied by iris-redis. If you'd like more than the 20MB default, please
      contact <all@nodeknockout.com>.

    - **[MongoDB](https://github.com/nodejitsu/handbook#mongodb)** —
      Both [MongoLab](#mongolab) and [MongoHQ](#mongohq) are providing larger
      instances for use during Node.js Knockout. Find instructions for each
      below. If you want, `jitsu databases create mongo myMongo` works though.

    ## <a name="mongolab">MongoLab</a>

    [MongoLab](http://mongolab.com) is a full-featured MongoDB-as-a-Service
    cloud solution that completely automates the operational aspects of running
    MongoDB. With the MongoLab cloud platform developers can deploy and manage
    highly available databases for their applications and leverage automated
    backups, web-based tools, 24/7 monitoring, and expert support. Free 500MB
    databases are available on Amazon AWS, Azure, Joyent, and Rackspace.

    No special credentials are needed to use MongoLab's free 500MB plan during
    Node Knockout. Just [sign up to get a free
    account](https://mongolab.com/signup/).

    Check out the [getting started blog post](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/35339780516/mongolabs-joyent-hosted-mongodb-quick-start)
    for how to quickly get up and running with MongoLab.

    ## <a name="mongohq">MongoHQ</a>
    MongoHQ is the fastest and easiest way to create a MongoDB database to use
    with your application. Our goal is to allow developers to focus on what they
    do best while we keep your database fast, optimized and reliable. It takes
    [less than 30 seconds to sign up and create a MongoDB
    database](https://www.mongohq.com/signup).

    For NodeKnockout, we have available 512MB plans in multiple data centers.
    Simply sign up and create a database and you will have full access to our
    industry-leading tools and a friendly and intelligent support team. We're
    excited to see what you build ... Good luck!

    ## <a name="apigee">Apigee</a>

    **Apigee will give out $4,000 in November to great apps that use node.js + App Services — read the [blog post](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/35360694905/using-apigee-with-node) for details!**

    [Apigee App Services](http://apigee.com/about/developers) is a hosted cloud
    service to store, retrieve & query your data — and so much more. Create a
    user record in our database and boom — we automatically give you a method to
    let that user sign-in to the service (using OAuth), let him own other pieces
    of data, post stuff to his activity wall, and the ability to become friends
    & share data with other users — without having to write a single line of
    code. Want to store arbitrary data? If you can express it as JSON, we can
    store it!

    Check out the [getting started blog post](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/35360694905/using-apigee-with-node)
    for more&hellip;

    **To sign up during the knockout, please [go here](https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up)**.

    We have a [node SDK](https://github.com/apigee/usergrid-node-js-sdk) and
    plenty of [documentation](http://apigee.com/docs/app_services). If you need
    any help during the weekend, you can ping Rod or Tim on IRC (rockerston, timanglade in
    \#nodeknockout on Freenode), GTalk (rsimpson@apigee.com, tanglade@apigee.com), email
    (<rsimpson@apigee.com>, <tanglade@apigee.com>) or Skype (rockerston, timanglade).
