  ## Nominate an Expert Judge

  Expert judges are expected to be high-tech insiders including: founders, CEOs,
  CTOs, VCs, journalists, open source developers, and others.
  [See last year's judges](http://2010.nodeknockout.com/judging#judges) for
  examples.

  Judges will need to write 2-3 sentence reviews of 5-10 entries, judging
  just functionality (not code) along 4 dimensions: utility/fun, innovation,
  completeness and design. This will take approximately 2-3 hours between
  August 29 and September 5.
