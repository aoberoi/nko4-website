  # Too many teams!

  ### More spots *may* open at [0:00] or [12:00 UTC]

  To accommodate as many people as possible, we'll be releasing more team spots
  over time at [0:00] and [12:00 UTC] each day up until close of
  registration.

  Your options are:

  - Be here at [0:00] or [12:00 UTC] when we open up more spots.
  - Check back randomly. Teams may give up their spot at any time.
  - Peruse the [existing teams](/teams) and try to find one to join.
  - Tweet about your misfortune (be sure to mention [@node_knockout]) and
    we can try to help you find a team to join.
