        ### More spots will open up on Oct 1 and Nov 1

        To accommodate as many people as possible, we'll be releasing team spots in
        larger chunks _four_ more times: __Oct 1__ and __Nov 1__ at __[0:00]__ and
        __[12:00 UTC]__.

        Your options are:

        - Be here at [0:00] or [12:00 UTC] when we open up more spots.
        - Check back randomly. Teams may give up their spot at any time.
        - Peruse the [existing teams](/teams) and try to find one to join.
        - Tweet about your misfortune (be sure to mention [@node_knockout]) and
          we can try to help you find a team to join.
