      ## Nominating a Judge

      We need judges!

      Judges are expected to be high-tech insiders including: founders, CEOs,
      CTOs, VCs, journalists, open source developers, and others.

      Judges will be asked to write 2-3 sentence reviews of 5-10 entries, judging
      just functionality (not code) along 4 dimensions: utility/fun, innovation,
      completeness and design.
