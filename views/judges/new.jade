        ## Nominating a Judge

        We need judges!

        Judges are expected to be high-tech insiders including: founders, CEOs,
        CTOs, VCs, journalists, open source developers, and others.

        Judges will be asked to write 2-3 sentence reviews of 5-10 entries, judging
        just functionality (not code) along 4 dimensions: utility/fun, innovation,
        completeness and design.

        _Tip: Fill in the Twitter username first and it'll try to autocomplete the
        rest._
