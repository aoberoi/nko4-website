      ### We need judges

      Judges are industry insiders: founders, CEOs, CTOs, VCs, journalists, open
      source hackers, etc. **If you know a good judge candidate, please
      [nominate her or him](/judges/new).**

    ul.judges
      - each judge in judges
        li

          person = judge
          include ../people/details
