MongoLab provides MongoDB-as-a-Service on the Joyent Cloud (and on Cloud
providers) for the lowest latency between your Nodejitsu app and MongoDB.
500MB databases are available for free.  In a recent test, ping latency
averaged under 800 microseconds between our MongoLab Joyent servers and a
hosted jit.su server.  We have a web GUI for managing, searching, and editing
documents in MongoDB.  We also provide an authenticated [REST API][6] if you
need that.

After your database is populated with at least one collection, you can run and
save queries, and edit documents directly in our UI.  That makes development
with MongoDB even easier.
