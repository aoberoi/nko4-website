# (protip) Create a Perfect Pitch Video

This year, we're <strong style="color:firebrick">requiring contestants to
submit pitch videos</strong> for expert judging (40% of the score).

The point of the pitch video is to make it easier for judges to understand
what's awesome about your entry. It lets you show off your app in the best
possible light.

Below are some tips for creating a perfect pitch video.

## Answer 3 Questions

A great pitch video should answer 3 questions about your entry.

### 1. Who is it for?

What sort of people will use what you've built? Are they hackers or painters,
consumers or businesses? Are they busy, lazy, bored?

Describing your intended audience helps the video viewer build empathy for
the people who have the problem you're trying to solve.

### 2. Why would people use it?

What problem does your audience have? How does your service help them solve
the problem in a better way than they do it today.

Starting by describing the problem gets people excited to see your solution.

### 3. How does it work?

Here's the fun bit. Show how your product or service solves the problem that
you just described.

Remember to show your product in the best possible light, set up your demo so
that it avoids bugs and skips any tedious slow bits (e.g. data entry).

## How to Do It
