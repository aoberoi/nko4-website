*This is the 21st in series of posts leading up [Node.js Knockout][1],
and covers using [Spreecast][] during to collaborate with your team and
share with other participants around the world.*

## What is [Spreecast][]?

Spreecast lets groups share video experiences in real time.
With Spreecast, you can broadcast your live video to the world,
pulling in viewers to share the experience when it suits you,
and dismissing them when they're done. It's a fun format for
sharing at event locations and an awesome new way for
Node.js Knockout teams to coordinate their coding.

For Node.js Knockout you will be able to sign up and get
exclusive early, pre-beta access to Spreecast and unlimited
live video during the competition. Spreecast is pre-beta and
working hard to squash bugs and tune user experience. Weâ€™d
love to hear feedback on any bugs or issues that you encounter.
