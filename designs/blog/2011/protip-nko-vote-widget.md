# (protip) Add the Vote KO Badge to your App

Here's a quick tip: you should link to [your team's page][1] to get as
many votes as possible.

Alternatively, if you want to let people vote from your app directly,
you can use our "Vote KO" widget:

Here's how to use it:

    <iframe src="http://nodeknockout.com/iframe/YOUR_TEAM_SLUG" frameborder=0 scrolling=no allowtransparency=true width=115 height=25>
    </iframe>

You can find your slug from [your team's page][1]. The slug is the last
segment of the url (e.g. http://nodeknockout.com/teams/**fortnight-labs**)

Once you've deployed your widget, link to your app in the comments so
other people can see how you integrated it.
