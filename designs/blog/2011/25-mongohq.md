# Countdown to KO #25: MongoHQ

# Node Knockout: Getting Started with MongoHQ


We are happy to provide the full MongoDB infrastructure for the Node Knockout competition this year. Here are some brief instructions for how to get started with using our service.

1. Create a MongoHQ account.

    Go to https://www.mongohq.com/signup and create a MongoHQ account for you and your team. This will log you into MongoHQ.

1. Add your Node Knockout Database

    Assuming you are still logged into MongoHQ, visit this link: https://mongohq.com/databases/new?promo=nodeko and from there, you will see one of the database options is for a Node Knockout database. Select the database, give it a name, and click the green “Create” button.

1. Get your Connection Info

    Now that your database has been created, MongoHQ will present you with your connection strings. You can also access them from the “Database Info” tab. Now you can add the connection string to your application settings and you are ready to go.

### Drivers

Now that you are good to go, here are some popular drivers that you can use when running your projects. Please note that there is not an officially supported 10gen driver for Node and MongoDB. All these are community-supported.
