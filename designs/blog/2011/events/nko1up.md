![Radius SF](http://radiussf.com/images/radius_dr_01_500.jpg)

**contestants**: celebrate completing the Knockout, and meet (and try
and influence) some of the people who may be judging your work.

**judges**: connect with other judges, and meet the creators of the sites that
you're evaluating.

* **when:** 6-8pm on Wednesday 8/31
* **where:** [Radius Restaurant](http://radiussf.com/); [1123 Folsom St at 7th in San Francisco](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://maps.google.com/?q=1123+Folsom+St+SF+CA)

**parking**: There should be plenty of street parking, but there's also a lot
where guests can park next door at Oil Can Henry's.

See you there!
The NKO Crew
