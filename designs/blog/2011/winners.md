</h2><div>by <a href='http://nodeknockout.com/teams/speedo'>Speedo</a></div>

Observer allows you to watch your application users in real time, and
see in your browser what they are doing, all the events are duplicated
and emulated.

If a user clicks on a button that triggers an alert or a other
javascript interaction, the same interaction will happen on your page.
You can see what the users are typing or what keyboard shortcuts they
are using.

If you want to interact with the following user you can press the `chat`
button at the top of the menu bar to start a anonymous chat with them.

Don't have time to follow all your users? No problem, all session are
stored in our database so they can be re-played at a later point of
time.

</h2><div>by <a href='http://nodeknockout.com/teams/go-horse-brazil'>Go Horse Brazil</a></div>

Driv.in is an YouTube battle party in a virtual drive in. You can create
rooms to share with your friends and watch videos together in real time.
When your friends enter in the middle of the video, they will be
positioning at the point that everybody is viewing, so everybody will be
at the same video time. When the current video ends, the next video will
be played automatically.

This app is great for being a VJ for a day: create and share a playlist
of your favorite artist from YouTube. You and your friends can also
suggest new videos, throw tomatoes at the bad ones and chat along!

</h2><div>by <a href='http://nodeknockout.com/teams/rochester-js'>rochester-js</a></div>

**ACROnode** is a wordplay game where players are given a random acronym
and are challenged to create
"[backronyms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym)."  For example,
when presented with **NBAM** you might play **N**arwhal **B**acons
**A**t **M**idnight.

Loosely based on the original
[Acrophobia IRC game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia_\(game\)),
players score each other's backronyms and are awarded points based on
the number of votes, for being the first to submit your backronym, etc.

  Innovation:
  <a href='http://minimason.no.de/'>Blue GPU Lava</a>
</h2><div>by <a href='http://nodeknockout.com/teams/minimason'>Minimason</a></div>

Blue Lava is a small demo showing the node-webgl library written during
the first half of Node.js Knockout.

The entry is not the visualization itself, but the library that allows
it to run on node directly without the help of a browser.  The library
specifically targets the HP TouchPad, but it runs on other platforms as
well.

The visualization is a fairly simple OpenGL scene with fairly complex
GLSL shaders that push most the computation on the GPU.  The animation
is 100% procedural and rendered in real-time.

You can see a demo here: <http://creationix.com/minimason.m4v>

Using this library, a developer can create very advanced video games for
just about any modern platform and use node to write it.

The library can be found at <https://github.com/creationix/node-webgl>
and will be licensed under MIT.  It's published to npm under "webgl".
Patches are welcome after the contest to keep this alive and well.

Let's break the [Guinness world record for largest chess AI](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-networked-chess-computer/) !

Do you think you're good enough to beat the cloud? Give it a try.

Not a Chess GrandMaster? Join the machine uprising! To be a part of the
compute grid, just visit Chess@home or any page with a &lt;script&gt; we
provide (include it in your blog!). People with a few idle CPUs can also
launch a worker with npm.

(We plan to invite an actual GrandMaster along with a Guinness official
in a few weeks and coordinate online so that we all break the current
2070-world record and make Node.js a part of history! ;-) Follow
[@chess_at_home](http://twitter.com/chess_at_home) to be kept updated).

# Congratulations!

Congratulations to
